	- Identifiy assets
		- priortizie asset identification and assessment by crticality 
		- Review the critical processes and equipment first, those that if compromised could have the greatest negative impact 
	- identify threat
		- specific current info. on ICS threats and vulunerability can be researched
	- controls
		- security life cycle can be used as an effective tool when mapping security controls to each phase:
			- identification, project, detect, ...
	- vulunerability
	- likelihood
		- The DREAD model can be used as an indirectmeans of calculating consequences and likelihodd
	- impact
- avoid, reduce, accept, transfer risk <= not 100% protection
